                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">League FM is a internet radio station for young people. We will play Music 24/7 a day with sometimes a cool show with a deejay. You can register to become a deejay on our site without experience. We help everyone for free.
<br>The League FM Discord integration allows for users on Discord to listen to the League FM radio station in a voice channel with their friends. The bot directly plays our radio in any voice channel a user may choose live. This can all be done with one simple command. 
<br>
<br>
<br><strong>Agreement
</strong><br>
<br>By inviting the League FM Bot to your server and using it in your voice channel, you agree and allow the bot to store some information about your server which will allow the bot to function correctly. The League FM Bot will only store necessary data that it is needed for it to function correctly in your server. The bot will never store more data about you nor your Discord server if its not specified in our policy to you. You agree that the bot will use some of your server information for functional purposes only. All stored data will only be accessed by the League FM Bot and will not be used outside of the integration by us or other third party services. This means we will never share or sell your data to other people or other Discord integrations. Our team will also not use the data collected by the bot and it will not be accessed for use purposes. Only the bot will make changes or read your data. We will also notify you in advance before making any immediate changes to this policy. We will always give a 30 day advance warning where we will tell you what we are changing. You can contact us via our contact information if you are concerned or want to ask any questions about possible changes. This privacy policy will only be updated if very much needed.
<br>
<br> 
<br><strong>What we store
</strong><br>
<br>In this paragraph, you will find out the information we store about you or your server where you invite the integration/bot to. The agreement specified above applied to all of the data specified below. By inviting the integration/bot to the server, you acknowledge that we will collect the following information:
<br>
<br>The bot will store your <strong>Voice Channel ID</strong> of the channel you are in when you execute the <strong>/join</strong> command. The only ID the bot will store is the channel you are in when you run the command. No other channels will be stored.
<br>In addition to this, the bot will also store your <strong>Server Name</strong> when you execute the <strong>/join</strong> command. The bot will only store your server name once. The bot stores your server name to link it to your channel ID.
<br>
<br>This is the only data that the bot will collect from your server upon running the main command. If you wish to find out how to remove your data from the bot, you can read the section <a href="privacy-policy.html#bottom" class="text-primary"><strong>Requesting the removal of your data</strong></a> which is below.
<br>
<br>If you have any enquiries regarding anything which was said in this section, you can send us an email 
<br><a href="mailto:Aanvragen@league-fm.NL" class="text-primary"><strong>Aanvragen@league-fm.NL</strong></a>. 
<br>
<br><strong>Why we store this information
</strong><br>
<br>The information we collect which is stated in the above section is stored by our Discord integration for feature/function purposes only. 
<br>
<br>When the /join command is ran by a server administrator, as already specified, the channel ID is stored. This information is stored so that the bot can auto rejoin the specified channel automatically if the bot ever goes down or disconnects from the channel. This is a feature of the bot and is implemented for the reason of making the bot easier and more simpler to use. If the bot ever goes offline, the bot will auto rejoin the channel you originally ran the command in. This feature means you do not have to repeatedly run the command every time the bot is restarted. This is the only reason this information is stored and is only used by the bot to know what channel to join every time it connects to Discord. The bot will then stay in the channel indefinably unless removed from the channel or it goes down at any point.
<br>In addition to this, the bot will also store your server name so that bot knows what server your channel ID is linked to. This is to make data management easier and allowed easier access and removal of your data if you should request it. When the bot logs into Discord servers, it will use your server name to match it to your specified channel ID and the join the channel that you ran the command in. This is the only time your server name is accessed by the integration and is not used at any other point in the bot apart from when it is saved when you run the main command as already specified above. 
<br>
<br>In conclusion, the bot only stores information about your server for functional purposes and will not share any of the server data collected with outside services in any way. Secondly, your data will only be accessed by the Discord bot integration for function purposes. The data we collect will only be accessed by the bot and will not be used outside of the integration in any way.  
<br>
<br><strong>Requesting the removal of your data
<br></strong>
<br>If you wish for your data to be removed from our bot at any point in time while you are using our integration, there are several ways you can do so which offer complete removal of all of the stored server data the bot collected from your server. As the user of our service, you have full rights for the duration your server data is stored. We agree that if you do request a removal of your data that it will be removed from our integration storage as soon as the request for removal has been received. We will not ask questions as to why you wish us to remove your data nor will we stop you from removing your server data from our bot's storage.
<br>
<br>There are several ways you can request deletion of your data which are specified below:
<br>
<br>-<strong> Onsite methods
</strong><br>Discord server - You can join our public Discord server and request the removal of your data by contacting any     Administrator rank either in chat or via Discord direct messages. The member of staff may ask for your server     name so that we can ensure your server data is removed from the bot's storage. As soon as a staff member sees     your request, we will immediately begin the removal process for your server data.<br>
<br>Discord Bot command - Via our Discord Bot, there are several ways that you can automatically have your data     removed from our bot's storage. Firstly, you can run the command <strong>"/deletedata"</strong> in any channel in your server     and the bot will instantly remove the stored channel ID and server name. You will be made aware that this     process has been completed by a message sent by the bot in the same channel you run the command in. 
<br>    Secondly, if you wish to no longer use our service entirely, you can remove our integration from your     guild/server by kicking it from the server. Upon being kicked from the server, the bot will instantly delete the     stored server name and channel ID from the bot's storage. If you was to use our service in the future, you would     have to reset these values yourself as if you had never invited the bot before as the bot will no longer have them     stored. We believe that we should no longer have access to the data we stored if you decide to remove our     integration from your server. This is why the bot will remove this data as soon as it is kicked.<br><br>   
<strong>- Offsite methods</strong><br>Email - If you are unable to request removal from Discord itself, you can use our email to request deletion of your data. If you want your stored data removed from the bot's storage, you can send an email to our public email address&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Aanvragen@league-fm.NL" class="text-primary"><strong>Aanvragen@league-fm.NL</strong></a>. Upon receiving an email from you, we will instantly start the removal process for your data and may ask for your server name to make sure that all of your data is removed from the bot's storage. This process will not take long and you will be notified that your data has been removed by a email reply clarifying that we have removed the data we collected from your server. We will never ask for the reason for your request and will not refuse your deletion request for any reason either.<br><br>The methods explained can be used by you and you will always be allowed the rights to how long we store your data for.<br><br><strong>Contact</strong><br><br>If you have any enquiries or have a concern, you can use one of these methods to contact the League FM team.<br>If you find any flaws in this policy, please reach out using the contact information below.<br><br>Discord:&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Ra3CqFWmpZ" class="text-primary" target="_blank"><strong>https://discord.gg/Ra3CqFWmpZ</strong></a><br>Website:&nbsp;<a href="https://league-fm.nl" class="text-primary" target="_blank"><strong>https://league-fm.nl</strong></a><br>Email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Aanvragen@league-fm.NL" class="text-primary"><strong>Aanvragen@league-fm.NL</strong></a><br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>End of the policy.
